Snake Game 🐍

	As a team, we decided to create our first game—Snake Game 🐍. It took us about 4 days to develop it, and we gave our best effort. We faced many challenges, but we overcame them, and we hope you enjoy the game 😊.

How to Play:

Playing is very simple ^_^

- Press the Start button to begin the game and try to achieve the highest score 😉.
- Choose the difficulty level: [Easy - Normal - Hard].
- Challenge your friends in Hard mode 😈 to see who is the best 🤩.
- Use the controls:
  - W : Move Up
  - S : Move Down
  - D : Move Right
  - A : Move Left
- Press the Pause button if you need a break 😴.
- Try to eat as many fruits as possible 🍒.

That's it, and we hope you enjoy the game ❤. Have fun 😊.
